In this project, we configure an entire Enterprise Cisco Network environment based on the 3-layer LAN Architecture.

<p>Environments and Technologies Used:

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Switches
- Cisco Multilayer Switches
- Cisco Routers
- Cisco Command Line</p>

<p>This Project will consist of 21 Objectives:
   
1. Setup Hostnames
2. Configure EtherChannels in each Department
3. Configure Trunk Ports
4. Configure VLANs via VTP
5. Configure Access Ports
6. Disable Unused Ports
7. Configure R1’s IP addresses
8. Enable IP Routing on all Distribution & Core switches
9. Configure PAgP EtherChannel between Core Switches
10. Configure IP addresses for all Core Switch interfaces
11. Configure IP addresses for all Distribution Switches
12. Configure Management IP addresses on Access Switches via VLAN 10
13. Configure Rapid PVST+ on Distribution & Access Switches
14. Enable PortFast & BPDU Guard on all active access ports
15. Configure OSPF for R1, Core Switches, & Distribution Switches
16. Enable DHCP
17. Enable SSH access 
18. Configure Extended ACLs 
19. Configure Port Security
20. Configure User Accounts
21. Save the Running-Config
